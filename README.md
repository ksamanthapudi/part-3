Description: created a java parsing class where we passed xml and xds  using schema and xml using DTD.

Steps;
1. Created XML document and created "DomParserSchema" class.
2. After going through second chapter of Dr.Lixin Tao's i have written a code 
3. I created a seperate file names "shops.xml" and "shops.xds".
4. After debugging the code i got the expected output.
5. In the 2nd step:
6. I created another file name "DomParserDTD" class and reated a file "shops.xml"
7. Here i created only Xml file as per requirements and thus got the required output.
